## P1 - Dry Bean Classification

The aim of this practical is to gain experience in applying machine learning methodology to a real dataset. The focus is on good understanding and justification of steps involving data processing, training and evaluation.

## P2 - Classification of seal images

The main aim of this practical is to gain experience in working with real experimental, imperfect, and limited data which has not been analysed before. To read and process and clean the data from the dataset in a suitable way. To then create a classification model to predict output classes based on a set of inputs and evaluate its performance. It is particularly important that the evaluation is carefully described along with a discussion of the limitations of the data and of the method used.

The project involved two datasets containing features extracted from small images (60Ã—60 pixels). The small images were cropped from larger aerial images obtained during seasonal surveys of islands in the North Sea. The task is to classify (Binary and Muilt) these images based of what type of seal pup is contained within them.
